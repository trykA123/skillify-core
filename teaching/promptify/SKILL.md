name: promptify
description: Teaches you to prompt more concisely by debriefing your real conversations — one concrete improvement per session, drawn from your own words, optionally tracked on an evidence-based skill map. Quick and ephemeral by default. Use after a discussion, or to sharpen a draft prompt.

# Promptify

Your words are the curriculum — not generic prompt advice. Each session teaches one
thing you can use immediately.

A skill that teaches conciseness has to be concise, so: quick mode is the default,
one lesson per session, and re-teaching is the only sin.

## Choose persistence first

**Ephemeral** is the default: teach in chat, read no learning profile, and write no
profile, lesson, skill-map or session record. Use only the current conversation.

**Tracked** requires an explicit request to track progress, save the lesson, update an
ongoing coaching profile, or record the session. Resolve `<learning-root>` from runtime
configuration; when none is supplied, use `~/.skillify/learnings/`.

The lesson may be quick or durable in either persistence mode. “Quick” controls teaching
depth; “tracked” controls side effects.

## Load first — tracked only

Read `<learning-root>/promptify/profile.md` (create it from `seeds/profile.md` on first
run), the glossary, and `<learning-root>/progress.json`. The profile is who you're
teaching — level, goals, known terms, observed habits.

## Harvest

Scan the conversation for one or two high-signal patterns:

- **A win** — a prompt that got exactly what it wanted. Name the move it made.
- **A cost** — wordiness, a buried request, missing format, re-stating what the agent
  already knew.
- **A thinking pattern** — asked *how* before *why*, bounded the options, gave an
  authorization path.

Use their real words. **Never invent an example** — a fabricated illustration teaches a
habit they don't have.

In tracked mode, check the index. Is this pattern, or a near-twin, already in the
profile's known terms or the `lessons/` filenames? If so: teach a different pattern,
go a level deeper, or skip with a one-line pointer. In ephemeral mode, use only what the
current conversation proves. Re-teaching is the only sin — it's what turns a coach into
a nag.

## Teach one thing

One pattern, one fix, in chat, fitting on one screen: the pattern in their words, what
it costs or earns, and the fix as before → after. Coaching a draft? Show the sharpened
version and name the moves you made.

Two strong patterns means teach the better one. In tracked mode, note the other in the
profile.

## Quick mode is the default

Most teaching moments are small — a one-line fix, a reframe, a nudge. Chat only. No
lesson file, no HTML. Ephemeral quick mode stops there. Tracked quick mode updates the
profile with one dated habit line and the skill map with an evidence entry whose
artifact is `null`; say *“quick tracked lesson — no durable lesson artifact.”*

**Escalate to a saved lesson only when** the pattern has recurred three or more times
(a habit, not a slip), the improvement takes several moves rather than one, the user
asks for something durable, or it's fundamental enough that re-teaching it later would
waste real time.

Escalating means `lessons/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` — title, the pattern in their words,
what it costs, the fix as before → after, and one exercise sized to their actual
upcoming work. Optionally the same as a single-file HTML page. Add at most three
glossary terms, each with real definitional weight and their own example.

## Tracked learning

When tracking is requested, update the learning runtime's profile and progress store
under `<learning-root>`. Keep one dated observation for the habit taught, with honest
positive or negative evidence. If the runtime provides a competency map, use its
vocabulary; Skillify does not require a particular progress schema or renderer.

No XP, streaks, or badges are implied. The durable signal is a concise record of what
changed and what still needs practice.

Record the session through recordify only when tracking was requested.

## Done when

They can state the fix in their own words, or try it in their next message. In tracked
mode, the map also holds honest evidence for what was touched.

The failure this skill has to avoid is being unwelcome: teaching mid-flow when nobody
asked, lecturing without a lesson, or explaining something already taught.

description: Writes a sanitized session record — the pattern practiced plus a de-identified gist, never verbatim quotes, paths, project names or identifiers — and refuses to write if the automated privacy gate finds anything. Called by promptify and explainify at their done path, or on an explicit "record this session".

# Recordify

Capture what a session practiced, with the privacy gate enforced rather than promised.

This is a subroutine more than a mode of work: promptify and explainify call it when
they finish. It fires at commit or push when the session's artifacts land, or on an
explicit "record this". **Never write a record from memory of a session you didn't read,
or from a transcript you haven't opened.**

## The record

One markdown file per session, written to `RECORDS_DIR`, named `<id>.md`.

```markdown
---
id: sess-2026-08-02-name-the-referent
date: 2026-08-02
skill: promptify                # promptify | explainify | pipeline
competencies_touched: [P6, U2, W2]
outcome: completed              # completed | partial | abandoned (optional)
artifact: null                  # sanitized relative path, or null (optional)
evidence:
  - competency: P6
    note: "Under-specified ask cost a guessing round — the lesson was named in one line"
    valence: negative
  - competency: U2
    note: "Read the actual configuration before asking — the answer was in the file"
    valence: positive

# <Title — the pattern, not the project>

## What happened
<sanitized prose: the pattern, the cost, the fix>

## What worked
## What didn't
```

Competency ids are the skill map's vocabulary: `P1`–`P7` prompting, `U1`–`U4`
understanding, `W1`–`W3` pipeline. `evidence[].competency` must be one of them.

**Negative evidence is growth, not a stain.** A record with only wins in it is a record
that will teach nobody anything.

## The privacy gate — non-negotiable

Store the pattern and a sanitized gist. Never store:

1. **Verbatim quotes** — paraphrase to the lesson. A remark about how a theme feels
   becomes *"the felt effect was named first, then the fix."*
2. **Paths and URLs** → "a screenshot was attached", "the local config".
3. **Project, repo or product names** → their generic category ("a web app").
4. **Code or DOM identifiers** → their role ("a row container", "the rating function").
5. **Personal identifiers** — names, emails, handles, IPs, hex tokens, UUIDs.

**You paraphrase; the sanitizer only de-identifies.** Every evidence `note` is rewritten
by hand into a third-person gist with the meaning intact. `sanitizeNote` is a last-mile
pass — a note that still needs it is a note you haven't finished writing.

The gate is automated. `sanitize.mjs`, colocated beside this file, exports `scanRecord(md)`, which
is frontmatter-aware: it scans the free text that carries meaning — every
`evidence[].note`, the title, the body — and never the raw YAML, whose quoted scalars
would false-positive.

`<skill-dir>` below is the directory holding this SKILL.md — resolve it with
`dirname "$(readlink -f <path-to-this-skill>/SKILL.md)"`, since the install is a symlink
back into the repo and the flat harness layout has no `teaching/` parent.

```bash
bun -e "
import { scanRecord } from '<skill-dir>/sanitize.mjs';
import fs from 'node:fs';
let bad = 0;
for (const f of process.argv.slice(1)) {
  const leaks = scanRecord(fs.readFileSync(f, 'utf8'));
  if (leaks.length) { console.error('LEAKS in ' + f + ':\n' + leaks.join('\n')); bad++; }
  else console.log('clean: ' + f);
}
process.exit(bad ? 1 : 0);
" data/records/*.md
```

**If it returns anything, the record is refused.** Paraphrase and re-gate; do not ship
it. `bun test <skill-dir>/sanitize.test.mjs` is the contract. `detectLeaks` covers
quoted spans, paths, URLs, emails, IPs, hex tokens, known identifiers and verbatim speech.
When a new identifier family shows up in real sessions, add it to the blocklist **with a
test case** — an unenforced rule here is worse than none, because the promise stays.

## Then

Write the file, and tell the user one line: which competency gained evidence, or which
gap was exposed. If the skill map app is running it picks the record up on its next
compile.
